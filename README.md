# Win8SteadyStateTools
Updating tools for a Windows 8 (and beyond) Steady State Config. These are built on Panos Macheras' Win7 Steady State Solution found here: http://blogs.technet.com/b/panosm/archive/2011/07/07/windows-7-steadystate-solution-simplified.aspx

The above blog was a great jumping off point for a SteadyState config but we needed one for our laptops and domain connected devices so I'm going to dump much of the work we've done to this page.
